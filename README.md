# Zero to App: Live coding a Firebase app in JavaScript, Kotlin, and Swift

This is the code from a live coding session at Google I/O 2017. During the session we built an emoji-centric picture-chat app on three platforms simultaneously. 

## Talk details

Before you dive into the code, watch [the talk on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01M_hZav9Gw). This code makes a lot more sense with context.

Oh, and the game is still live at [mojaic.io](https://mojaic.io/)!
